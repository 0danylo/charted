Charted is a simple Material app that creates graphs of data over time.

- Plot any decimal value against a date and time
- Create unlimited graphs and points, and delete them at will
- View graphs as a line, line with points, just points, or steps

The interface is a single scrollable page and data is backed up locally in a legible file called "data.txt".
